                        <h2>Jay’s Biography</h2>
                        <p>Jay began his career in the insurance industry in 1978. His first 14 years was split between Sentry Insurance and The Hartford where he was rated the #1 Production Underwriter in the country several years in succession.</p>
                        <p>In 1995 Jay was hired by a large independent agency (60 employees) as their Program Manager. By 2001 Jay had built 6 very successful programs that were a key factor in annual double-digit growth for that agency.</p>
                        <p>From 2001 until 2007 Jay was Vice-President of Sales and Marketing for the agency that he helped guide to become the largest agency in Western Michigan with an employee count of over 120. Following the sale of this agency Jay became Vice President of Sales for its parent company of 250+ employees until 2012. During this time period Jay was recruited by 7 insurance companies to participate on their respective advisory councils in order to assist growth for both carriers and agency.</p>
                        <p>In 2013 Jay decided to take his passion for mentoring others and growing businesses by starting his new company….. JJ FAGAN & CO. LLC with its tagline clearly describing the mission of his company, Connecting People….Connecting  Businesses. His goals: To have fun and build new opportunities for himself by building new connections for his clients.</p>
                        <p>Later in 2013 Jay teamed up with his long-time friend and insurance professional – Ted Kuzma – and together created Celtic Partners LLC. This company is designed specifically to assist smaller insurance agencies in Western Michigan in setting aggressive growth goals, building a business plan to achieve those goals, and holding all involved to be accountable to these goals.</p>
                        <p>Jay continues to successfully develop significant new Programs for his clients in an effort to lead their growth. He also continues to branch out into numerous other teaching and mentoring roles for more than two dozen other clients. Jay is indeed having fun!</p>
